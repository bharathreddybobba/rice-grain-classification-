1. Introduction:
This project aims to develop a system for classifying different types of rice grains and assessing the quality of rice based on its classification.
The process involves two main phases: classification of rice types and quality assessment of classified rice.

3. Classification of Rice Types:
In the first phase, we implement a classification model to categorize various types of rice grains. This phase involves preprocessing the rice grain images,
extracting relevant features, and training a classification model using machine learning or deep learning techniques. The model should be trained on a dataset
containing images of different rice varieties to accurately classify them.

5. Quality Assessment of Rice:
Once the rice grains are classified into different types, the second phase focuses on assessing the quality of the classified rice. Quality assessment may
involve analyzing various attributes such as grain size, shape, color, texture, and any defects present. This phase may utilize image processing techniques,
statistical analysis, or machine learning algorithms to evaluate the quality of rice based on predefined quality parameters.

7. Implementation:
The project can be implemented using programming languages such as Python, along with libraries and frameworks like OpenCV, scikit-learn, TensorFlow,
or PyTorch for image processing and machine learning tasks. The classification and quality assessment modules can be developed as separate components,
each with its own set of functionalities.

9. Usage:
To use the system, users can input images of rice grains into the classification module to determine their types. Once classified, the quality assessment module
can be applied to assess the quality of the classified rice based on predefined criteria. The system may provide outputs indicating the type of rice and its quality
assessment results.

11. Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements to the project may include refining the classification model for improved accuracy, integrating real-time image processing capabilities for on-the-fly
classification, and expanding the quality assessment criteria to cover additional attributes of rice quality. Additionally, the system could be deployed as a mobile or web
application for easy access and usability.
